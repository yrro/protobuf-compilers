# protobuf-compilers

This project builds static binaries of the [Google Protocol Buffers](https://github.com/google/protobuf) compilers, along with a [plugin for generating Objective-C code](https://github.com/alexeyxo/protobuf-objc).

## Why do you want to do that?

The code generated by `protoc` depends on a runtime library, the version of which must match the version of `protoc` that originally generated the code. Making available several different versions of `protoc` means that clients can generate code that will work with whichever protobuf-runtime version they want to use.

## Building

If you're on a Debian system, run `dpkg-buildpackage -b` as normal.

If not then you will have to install Bash, GCC, GNU Tar and GNU Make, as well as the tools listed in the `Build-Depends` field of the [debian/control](debian/control) file, and then run `make` (with `-j 4` if you have 4 CPUs, for added speed!).
